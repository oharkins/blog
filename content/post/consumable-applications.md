# Writing Cross-Divisional Consumable Applications

Creating applications that can be used across different divisions of a company is crucial for efficiency and consistency. Over the past three years, I've been working on an application aimed at cross-divisional use. 

This experience has shown me critical factors in product adoption. I wish more companies would build their code in a way that other divisions can reuse. Here are key strategies I've used to encourage adoption and prevent redundant solutions:

1. Modular Design: Build your application with modular components that can be easily integrated or customized for different divisions' needs.

2. Flexible Configuration: Implement robust configuration options to allow each division to tailor the application to their specific requirements without modifying the core codebase.

3. Clear Documentation: Provide comprehensive, easy-to-understand documentation that covers installation, usage, and customization options. Include videos, Postman examples, and code samples to enhance understanding.

4. Open Communication: Engage with other divisions early in the development process to understand their needs and concerns. Regular updates and feedback sessions help ensure the application meets diverse requirements. Frequent idea sessions prevent developing user-specific code down the road.

5. API-First Approach: Design your application with a strong API layer, allowing other divisions to integrate it into their existing workflows and systems easily. Make it easy to consume, test, and experiment with.

6. Scalability: Ensure your application can handle the combined load of multiple divisions and scale as needed.

7. Standardization: Adhere to company-wide standards for coding, security, and data management to facilitate easier adoption across divisions. Clear, well-structured code helps other developers understand how certain things are done, accelerating their development process.

8. Training and Support: Offer training sessions and dedicated support to help other divisions onboard and use the application effectively. Have developers work together to expedite the process.

9. Showcase Success: Demonstrate the benefits of using your application, including time saved, improved efficiency, and cost reductions, to encourage adoption. This shows that what they need is achievable and that using this solution is better than writing their own.

By following these strategies, you can create applications that are more likely to be adopted across divisions, reducing duplication of effort and promoting a more unified technological ecosystem within your company. This not only helps with financial aspects of a company but also fosters cross-developer cohesion.
